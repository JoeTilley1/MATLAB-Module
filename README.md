# MATLAB-Module
A second year MATLAB module at the University of Warwick. Instead of the codes, I have included the reports to the answer sheets. The assessments involved implementing various numerical methods and statistical experiments, such as employing Gauss-Seidel and methods of finite differences to solve PDEâ€™s.
